tutorHello=Hi! Click here to continue.
tutorMsg1=Now is roughly 2 million years B.C. The Early Stone Age. (Lower Paleolithic). Somewhere in Eastern Africa. [CLICK ME]
tutorMsg2=Before you, most likely lies the economy of the Homo ergaster — Working man. [CLICK]
tutorMsg3=You command a bunch of 3 hominids who collectively manage all the product that they produced [TAP]
tutorMsg4=But labor productivity is still very low, most of the product has to be consumed directly, while only 1% can be saved for accumulation [TAP]
tutorMsg4.2=The thin (gnawed) part of the scale shows how much of this product is directly consumed "as food". Now it is 99% of the product
tutorMsg6=The difference between the number of produced and consumed products is called the "surplus product" — you are in charge of it (look above). [CLICK]
tutorMsg7=Apparently, homo ergaster was the earliest of our ancestors who mastered hunting. Meantime, they only wield gathering . [CLICK ME]
tutorMsg8=Gathering is the first type of production available. By expanding production, we turn a free product into a new workplace (a new means of production). \
  \n\nTASK: let's scout the nearby forests a little - up to 6 workplaces in Gathering
tutorMsg8_1=Congratulations, you have a new able-bodied tribesman. The population of your group will constantly grow. You can understand when a new adult worker will appear on this scale. [CLICK]
char_tutorMsg8_1=So far, we cannot really directly influence population growth
tutorMsg8_2=Your herd needs food! We have no claws, no fangs — find a creative solution.\
  \n\n Task: Pick up a stick and use it (see "IMPROVEMENTS" menu — "star" icon below)
tutorMsg9=With time you will witness empires crashing down, the magnificence of planetary exploration, time travel and much more beyond that, but for now, good luck on your journey!

char_hello=Hi! How are you doing?
char_tutor7=Each type of production has a productivity value — how much product each worker produces. Gathering productivity now is 1.01
char_tutor7_1=The number of workers and workplaces is displayed on the scale below, now 3 out of 5 places are occupied
char_newProd_hunting=A new production appears besides Gathering: Hunting\
  \nHunting is more productive, but the hunter's equipment requires more resources.
char_kleinMoveTutor=People will independently move to production with higher productivity (for example, from Gathering to Hunting)
char_familyCommune=Times change. Now each family independently disposes of their product. With this product they will build the means of production for themselves. \
  \n\n60% of the product is still at the disposal of the community council.
move_slaves_tutor=Pay attention, the masters are trying to assign their slaves to the most productive industries
char_lumpenTutorial=The unemployed, or the lumpen proletariat, appear. For some reason they do not participate in production. With them (voluntarily or involuntarily) the producing classes share the product.\
  \nThe more unemployed, the slower the population grows.
char_slavery_tutor=After the last battle, the council of warriors decided to force the prisoners to work, not to include them in the tribe as equals. New class: Slaves
char_slavery_tutor_0=Slaves give all the product they produce to the owners of the means of production they work on. They receive back only the minimum amount of product necessary for reproduction.
char_slavery_tutor_color=Another color corresponds to slave labor. It can be seen that a share of their free product goes to free tribesmen.
char_slavery_tutor_color_2=And a production card shows that a certain number of slaves work on the means of production of the tribesmen
char_slavery_tutor_color_3=If you come to my light (top right), I will tell you more about the class diagram.
char_famous_tutor_1=New class: slave owners\
  \nFirst class of real exploiters. They already receive most of their product from slaves, and not from their own labor.
char_famous_tutor_2=The slave owners grew out of the clan nobility, shamans and leaders. We are now running this ruling class.
char_famous_tutor_3=We get our product only from our means of production (dark red). Small owners manage their own. At least now
char_conflictTutorial_1=Oh! Something is happening here!
char_conflictTutorial_2=Everything is similar to general production, but conflicts "produce" percentages of victory 
char_conflictTutorial_3=It's like a tug of war, only deadly. Good luck!

  \n — The enemy attacks in 16 days since the last battle or our retreat, unless we get ahead of them.\
  \n — Intelligence reports after 8 days since the last battle (or retreat).\
  \n Battle policy:\
  \n1. Air battle: The winner deals additional damage to the ground forces of the enemy during ground combat (based upon air force superiority)\
  \n2. Ground battle: The attacking side with a significant preponderance of forces breaks through, inflicting damage behind enemy lines and to Air-Defences thus shifting the front line.\
  \n3. Air bombardment is initiated only when the attacking side wins in air combat. Anti-Aircraft defenses (damaged in the event of a break-through of ground forces) inflict damage to air forces. Remaining air-forces deal damage to the rear.

feudRevo_not_accept_title=Great War
feudRevo_not_accept_descr=Collect all the forces of the empire on the greatest campaign in history! The loot and a fresh stream of slaves will save our economy.

capitalRevo_accept_title=Support the opposition
capitalRevo_accept_descr=The capital with all its factories supports the rebels. For the republic! For the equality of all before the money! For private property!

capitalRevo_not_accept_title=Feudalism is eternal
capitalRevo_not_accept_descr=Saddle up my Quetzal. The Emperor will never be equal to a servant.

ev_metallRadio_title=Bankruptcy
ev_metallRadio_descr=As folk wisdom says: better clay in your hand than iron in the sea. Mass mining of metal, organized by you, has brought many benefits in various industries, but in market conditions it turned out to be unprofitable. \
  \n\nYou are bankrupt.

ev_feudRevo_title=The slave farming crisis
ev_feudRevo_descr=The wars of conquest of our empire are no longer so great, they bring less and less slaves. Slave prices are rising, making slave farming unprofitable. \
  \nMany latifundists release their slaves by leasing land to them, which is contrary to our and God's laws and the eternal morality of our ancestors. \
  \n\nIt is necessary to somehow solve the current crisis.

ev_feudRevoWin_title=Civil war…
ev_feudRevoWin_descr=…in which we won. The advanced farms, using the labor of free peasants, as well as the bulk of the slaves, took our side.\

ev_feudRevoLoose_descr=The slave economy of the empire broke and collapsed. Descendants will remember you as the Emperor of Chains.\

ev_socRevo_title=Worker uprisings
ev_socRevo_descr=The workers are tired of uncertainty about the future, endless work, debts and war. They see that all the fruits of the progress made by their hands go not to them, but to a handful of so-called owners.\
  \n\nThe silhouette of the Trias is on their banners — an animal whose life is on 90% consists of labor. They chant: «We can own»

socRevo_warn=Worker uprisings
ev_socRevoWin_title=Socialist Republic
ev_socRevoWin_descr=Trias is not stupid - every animal worker knows the high intelligence of an animal. He just loves to walk very much and cannot stand standing still. Trias giants cannot be forced - they never stop on command.\
  \n\nThe organized mass of workers took power into their own hands.

ev_socRevoLoose_title=Defeat
ev_socRevoLoose_descr=Trias is not stupid - every animal worker knows the high intelligence of an animal. He just loves to walk very much and cannot stand standing still. Trias giants cannot be forced - they never stop on command.\
